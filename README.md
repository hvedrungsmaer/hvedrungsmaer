  Hey there, I'm Raeshelle, or Rae for short.

  I am a software engineer creating web applications that tell impactful stories, improve the user experience and bring people together. I love learning new things about design and development through making cool projects.  

How I'm learning the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) framework: I'm creating a web based RPG game inspired by cowboys, Norse Mythology and climate change. Currently in Pre-Production.

Ask me about Dragon Age or Avatar: The Last Airbender
